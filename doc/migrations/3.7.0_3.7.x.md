## Maps in the `archive_message` hooks for MAM

We refactored the MAM (XEP-0313) implementation, replacing the long lists of arguments accepted by the `mam_archive_message` and `mam_muc_archive_message` hooks with a more readable key-value structure (a map). This requires action from your side only if you modified the code, adding your own custom backend for MAM. In this case you might need to update the handlers for these hooks in your code. You can find the changed hooks in the `mongoose_hooks` module.
