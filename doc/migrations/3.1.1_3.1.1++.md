## **`odbc` renamed to `rdbms` in module names and options**

* **For MongooseIM users:** simply replace all instances of `odbc` in your config files with `rdbms`.
  E.g. `{odbc_server, {mysql, "server", 1234, "database", "username", "password"}}.` would become `{rdbms_server, {mysql, "server", 1234, "database", "username", "password"}}.`, and `{auth_method, odbc}.` would now be `{auth_method, rdbms}.`.<br/>
  It's also important to note that all metrics that previously contained `odbc` in their names have also been renamed to contain `rdbms` instead.

* **For developers calling MongooseIM modules:** most modules, functions and atoms had `odbc` in their names replaced with `rdbms`.
  The only exceptions to this rule were names actually pertaining to the ODBC driver, e.g. `mongoose_rdbms_odbc` or `ejabberd_check:check_database_module(odbc)`.

## **`ejabberd.cfg` renamed to `mongooseim.cfg`**

Rename the existing config file of MongooseIM from `ejabberd.cfg` to `mongooseim.cfg`.

## Pools configuration

Configuring pools to external services has changed, please see [Outgoing Connection doc](../advanced-configuration/outgoing-connections.md) for more details.

NOTE: Keep in mind that outgoing_pools is a list of pools, it may turn out that you will have more than one entry in the list when more than a single outgoing pool is needed.

### ElasticSearch configuration migration

Change the existing entry in the configuration file:

```erlang
{elasticsearch_server, [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]}.
```

to:

```erlang
{outgoing_pools, [
 {elastic, global, default, [], [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]}
]}.
```
